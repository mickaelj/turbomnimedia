# turbomnimedia

Simple and light turbo media php/jquery script.


Usage :

	1) copy your files in comic directory (ex: comic/mydir)
	2) create a config file at root with the same name (ex: mydir)
	3) add the list of files in this config file with xxx | prefix :
		- img | for images files
		- url | for embeding urls
	4) create a css file in comic directory (ex: mydir.css), by default, if not exist, "css/default.css" is read.
	5) modify as you want index.php to add your own icons or div.
	6) enjoy !


Mini help :

- Use arrow keys to navigate (left -> prev, right -> next, up, first page, down, last page) or arrows icons.

- You can use special css, just add your custom css in comic directory whit the same nome (ex: comic/myidea/myidea.css). 

- Image size is not detected, y must fix it in the css. (Todo ???)

TODO :

	Reorganize dir (config, css and images files in same directory)
	add options (custom arrows icon, animation, etc.)
	add tests
